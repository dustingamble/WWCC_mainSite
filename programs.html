            <h3>Action for Neighbourhood Change</h3>
            <p>Victoria Village Action for Neighbourhood Change (ANC) is part of United Way of Greater Toronto’s neighbourhood development strategy across the city. It supports the development of resident leadership to create positive change in the community they live in. ANC is based out of the Victoria Park Hub in the Victoria Village neighbourhood. We actively work with individuals and groups in the neighbourhood to be part of decision-making processes and building community partnerships, in particular leverage resources through developing and supporting local networks. Our community engagement strategy is based on intensive research and community mapping, implementing a resident-led agenda that is renewed every year with participatory community planning and development processes. This includes a Resident Action Plan that is a responsive framework for community action by residents, defining neighborhood priorities to guide the scope of our work. Each spring, Resident Action Grants are also made available to provide seed funding for community initiatives meeting our priorities. Year-round, ANC works actively with groups and community partners including the City of Toronto and other key decision-makers to identify opportunities to enhance service delivery and infrastructure in Victoria Village.</p>

                <h3>On Your Mark</h3>
                <p>The On Your Mark tutoring program provides one-to-one and small group tutoring for students of Portuguese and Spanish speaking descent in elementary and high school. The program is geared to students who are at lower levels of academic achievement, specifically students who are in the early grades (primary division) lagging behind in literacy and numeracy standards for their grades and students who are attending special education support services. This program works with students at crucial points in high school; at the transition years and towards the end, to prevent drop-out and encourage the pursuit of post-secondary education. On Your Mark tutors operate their tutoring sessions on a student-centered approach to learning; sessions are organized around the needs of the individual student. Apart from academics, tutoring sessions are based on mentoring, building self-esteem and fostering friendships. On Your Mark youth have an opportunity to discuss with their tutor their educational and career goals towards entering high school and pursuing post-secondary education. – On Your Mark operates during the school year within both the public and catholic school boards.</p>

                <p>In 2009 we served over 300 students, worked with close to 200 volunteers, operated out of nine schools six days a week and welcomed students from 53 schools from both the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) and Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB).</p>

                <h3>HIPPY</h3>
                <p>The HIPPY program, funded by Citizenship and Immigration Canada, is an in-home program which assists newcomer parents of preschool-age children with preparing their children for entering kindergarten. Through early intervention, the program helps immigrant families with their settlement needs; ensures enhanced success for children headed to kindergarten; and enables parents to play a key role in this learning and settlement process. Home visitors are employed to work with families in their homes. The home visitors bring a new set of instructional materials weekly, and using role-play, they spend one hour per week with the parent(s) reviewing the materials which the parents then deliver to their child in 15-minute daily sessions. Newcomer families make a two-year commitment to participate 30 weeks per year, with the program which- runs concurrently with the school year. We work with 185 families and 210 children in Toronto.</p>
                <p>HIPPY, which stands for Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters, is an internationally recognized trademarked program brought to Canada in 2001 and operates in over 7 cities. For more information go to <a href="#">www.hippycanada.ca</a></p>
